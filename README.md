# C
Because if you're going to learn a language, why not learn the best?


### IPR.c
An algorithm I developed that is to be further implemented in a system where diverse (random) decisions matter.


### SAVC
An algorithm I concieved to find points within certain constraints on a 2D plane. Abstraction to 3D is possible.

### matrix_change.c
A fun project and collections of algorithms to swap Row-major and Column-major arrays. Might have use down the line in systems programming.
